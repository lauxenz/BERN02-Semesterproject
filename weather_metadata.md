# Metadata for weather.csv

This dataset contains weather information corresponding to the locations of the seismic events. It includes the following columns:

* **time**: The timestamp of the recorded data, indicating the specific date and time of the observation.
* **temperature**: The measured air temperature at the given time and location in degrees Celsius.
* **humidity**: The relative humidity at the given time and location, expressed as a percentage.
* **precipitation**: The amount of precipitation (e.g., rainfall, snowfall) recorded at the given time and location, typically in millimeters.
* **sealevelPressure**: The atmospheric pressure at sea level, recorded at the given time and location, typically in hPa (hectopascals).
* **surfacePressure**: The atmospheric pressure at the surface level, recorded at the given time and location, typically in hPa (hectopascals).
* **lat**: The latitude coordinate of the location where the event was observed.
* **lng**: The longitude coordinate of the location where the event was observed.
* **nst**: The minimum number of seismic stations used to determine an event at a specific location.

*You can assume that each event can be uniquely identified by the date and its corresponding location (latitude and longitude).*
